Branching & Merging

What is a branch?

Think of it as a parallel line of development.
main (or master) is the default branch.
You create other branches to work on features/bug fixes without touching main.

git branch                         # list branches
git branch new-feature             # create a branch
git checkout new-feature           # switch to branch
git checkout -b new-feature        # create + switch in one step


You are in the root directory /, not your repo folder. Git commands only work inside a folder initialized as a Git repo.

Go to your repo folder
cd ~/GIT_PRACTICE

Confirm it’s a Git repo
git status
If it shows the branch and staged/unstaged files, you’re good.
If it says .git not found, you may need to git init or clone the repo again.

Check branches
git branch -a
Shows local and remote branches.

Create or switch to main

If main exists on remote:
git checkout -b main origin/main

If not, create locally:
git checkout -b main

git merge feature-branch
git push -u origin main

git status is your friend — it shows files with conflicts.
